As inflation increases, companies are not willing to absorb the costs of production, instead, they tend to pass the costs onto consumers. Amazon is one of them. With the price of Amazon Prime increasing by 20% (from $79 to $99 CAD),

### Should I renew my Amazon Prime?

In this project I analyse my amazon order history to make a data driven decision taking into consideration my spending habits, budget and benefits of Amazon Prime brings me.

## Data Collection

<sub>Order history can be requested via the Request My Personal Information page. Once requested, a secure download link will be sent to the email address associated with the amazon account. This may take up to 30 days.</sub>


## Data Analysis

Most orders are below the minimum order amount to get free shipping for a non prime member ($25). This is consistent throughout the years. Suggesting that prime is worth renewing.

Purchase amount is not normally distributed. Most purchase orders fall in the range $10 - $18.


Given that the order amount doesn't have a normal distribution, and because the standard deviation is close to the mean, the median rather than the mean is a better measure of describing the 'average' amount per amazon order. Therefore, most amazon orders are below $24 CAD, which is still lower than the minimum amount of $25 to obtain free shipping if you are not a prime member in Canada. So close though!


### Modeling Shipping costs without Amazon Prime

Shipping rates depend on the shipping speed, the weight and the size of the items. For example, prime customers pay a flat rate of $6.99 for orders under $25, while non-prime members pay more than $11.99 for same-day shipping.

On the other hand, shipping rates for items sold by third party sellers and fulfilled by Amazon from outside Canada cost $4.99 + $3.28/kg and it takes 7-12 business days to arrive.

As a conservative measure, shipping rates are estimated as $7.99 per shipment.

### Conclusion
Although Amazon prime provides various benefits such as Prime Video, Prime Music, free shipping and exclusive deals, the only benefits I use are free shipping and exclusive deals. Based on my Amazon order history, prime provides value to me by lowering the total shipping costs I would have paid in a year, plus getting faster shipping. For example, in 2021 I would have paid $108.74 more on shipping costs if I was not a prime member. Therefore, next yearÂ I will renew my prime membership even if its price increased 20%. And I will continue to evaluate my decision on a yearly basis.
